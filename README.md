# fourier
2D signal analysis with the help of the Fourier transform and filter passes.

This repository holds jupyter notebooks that help with the visual understanding of linear filter passes, correlation, convolution and finally performing those
same operations in the frequency domain achieved by applying the Fourier transform to example 2D signals and images.
